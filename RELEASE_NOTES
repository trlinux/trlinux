0.58

- Updated Mult files for a number of contests.
   ARRL SS, CQP, NYQP, SALMONWA

- Updated CTY.DAT file to most recent relase

- Added support in KEYERARD.PAS for W9CF added parallel port commands

- Added support in Arduino code for W9CF parallel port commands.

- Fixed Cabrillo output for WA-SALMON-RUN

- Changed the domestic file used for the CW Sprint from S48P8.DOM to SPRINT.DOM

- For the Sprint, added Hawaii as a domestic mult.

- Fixed bug where the initial exchanges were getting screwed up if you
    loaded a log without PARTIAL CALL LOAD LOG ENABLE = TRUE. The exchange
    info wasn't initialized and it was being added to the AllCallList.

- Removed exchange window when returnning from SO2V QSO or not

0.57 (includes changes not documented for 0.56)

- A new log file is now being generated independently from the
  .DAT file.  This file has addition data in it to support
  showing exact frequency information when using serial nummbers.

  When you use the Cabrillo log generator and it sees the file
  LONGLOG.DAT, it will try to use the data there.  If the .DAT
  and the LONGLOG.DAT file are out of step with each other, you
  will need to make edits to fix the issue.  Or if you don't want
  to mess with it - just delete the LONGLOG.DAT file.  The most
  common reason for them to be out of step is if you made any
  edits to your log during the contest.  The ADIF conversion
  routine will also use this data.

- Fixed QSOBYBAND and QSOBYMODE not being properly setup for the 7QP.

- Implemented support of the so2sdr-bandmap program by N4OGW.  New
  commands are as follows:

  N4OGW RADIO ONE BANDMAP IP = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (127.0.0.1 for local)
  N4OGW RADIO ONE BANDMAP PORT = xxxx
  N4OGW RADIO ONE BANDMAP UDP PORT = xxxxx (default is 45454)
  N4OGW RADIO TWO BANDMAP IP = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (127.0.0.1 for local)
  N4OGW RADIO TWO BANDMAP PORT = xxxx
  N4OGW RADIO TWO BANDMAP UDP PORT = xxxxx (default is 45454)
  N4OGW FREQUENCY CONTROL = VFOA VFOB AUTO

  Auto will put the frequency into VFOA if you are in S&P, or VFOB
  if you are in CQ mode.  This is triggered by clicking on a callsign
  on the so2sdr-bandmap display.

- AUTO PARTIAL CALL FETCH implemented (control-J - default FALSE).
  When enabled, if you type three letters of a callsign, and it
  resolves to one - and only one - possible call (not SCP call),
  then the callsign will be rewritten with the full callsign when
  you press RETURN and that callsign will be answered.  This does
  not trigger auto start sending.

- Some work done to clean up RTTY functionality - and making it
  consistent between Classic and 2BSIQ interfaces.

- Updated the firmware for the Arduino in the SO2RMini to version
  TRCW V4 - or SO2RMini_2023_Feb_28.

  Note that the valid control characters that you can put in a
  meesage that the SO2RMini will process are:

    ^D - Long Dash
    ^F - Speed up CW by 2 WPM
    ^H - Half dit space
    ^I - Switch headphones to inactive radio
    ^J - Switch headphones to active radio
    ^S - Slow down CW by 2 WPM
    ^X - Switch Headphones to Radio 1
    ^Y - Switch Headphones to Radio 2
    ^Z - Switch Headphones to Stereo

- Added N1MM UDP PORT command (set to port number).  Allows the
  N1MM type QSO packets to be imported into the log.

- Added ability to send N1MM type QSO packets:

  QSO UDP IP = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
  QSO UDP Port = xxxx

  These packets have been tailored so that the K3IT Qsoorder
  program will be happy with them.

- Note - you can use the two above commands to send QSOs around
  to other computers in a multi-op.  However, the existing network
  commands are still supported (for now).

- Removed the Alt-D feature in 2BSIQ as it was causing too many issues.

- Eliminated use of SERIALNUMBER.TXT for serial number coordination.
  Serial numbers are now computed by looking at the log file (or
  LONGLOG) during start up of the program.  For contests like the
  SS where only one sequence of serial numbers is used, and using
  TBSIQ, the left radio will be at the next QSO number to be sent
  and the right radio one more than that.  Note that once a QSO
  number is "assigned" to a radio, it can not be used by the other
  radio.  So in this case, if you start making QSOs on the right
  radio, the original QSO number will be waiting on the left
  radio to be used whenever a QSO is finally made there.

0.55

- Many enhancements and bug fixes with the 2BSIQ user interface.  

- In 2BSIQ, you can now use the Alt-D command to enter a
  callsign similar to what you would do in the classic interface.
  If the other radio has the call window active, the call will
  be entered and when you press RETURN it will perform a dupe
  check.
  
- Dualing CQ is now supported (using Control-Dash) in 2BSIQ.  
  Will, work on RTTY and SSB with a K3/K4 radio.
  
- Better integration of the band map with 2BSIQ interface.

- Packet cluster support in 2BSIQ interface.

- RTTY supported with K3/K4 radios for transmission.  You still have 
  to read the display of the radio to get calls and exchanges and 
  enter them by hand.  

- New QSO number metodology implemented for 2BSIQ.  When you
  first start, you will have QSO #1 on the left radio and
  QSO #2 on the right radio.  Once you do something with
  a radio like starting to enter a call, that number will
  be locked until you log a QSO on that radio.  
  
  If you start running on the radio that has the lower 
  number and don't do anything on the other radio, the 
  QSO number will get "stoeln" from the inactive radio .
  
  If an old QSO number gets left behind on a radio, you 
  can update it to a new number using the call window
  command UPDATEQSONR.  Also, any unused QSO numebers
  will be skipped if you restart the program.  Currently,
  you must not use the option to log frequencies if you
  are using QSO numbers.  
  
- AutoCQ using AltQ and AltC now supported in TBSIQ.
 

0.54

- Implementation of new user interface enabling 2BSIQ opeation.
  To enter this - type the callsign 2BSIQ and hit RETURN.  You
  will end up with two sets of call/exchange windows.  The basic
  functions are all the same as the normal user interface.  There
  are still some unimplemented functions, but there is enough
  there to use it effectively on CW.  The SSB implementation has
  not been finished but has some basic functionality.

  You will need a 2nd USB keyboard which currently can not be the
  same model as your existing one.  Hopefully, we can remove that
  restriction in the next release.

  Serial number coordination between the two rigs is being done
  using a file called SERIALNUMBER.TXT.  If you want to start
  over with serial #1, delete (or better yet rename) this file.

- Added CWT and CWO contests.


0.53

- Updated score reporter URL.

- Allow control of the launch of rigctld. If only the port is given,
  rigctld commands are sent/received to/from port, but rigctld is
  not launched by TR.


0.52

- This is the first release done by N6TR instead of W9CF

- Added support for SO2R Mini - if running N6TR's firmware.  Use ardkeyer
  port = serial /dev/ttyUSB0.  You can see the version of the SO2R mini
  firmware in the Control-J Version entry - second column.  Version 2
  of the Arduino firmware was released in tandem with 0.52.

- Added support for SO2R mini commands in CW messages.  Use ^ to prefix
  the following commands:

    ^D - Long Dah
    ^F - Speed up CW 2 WPM
    ^H - Half dit space
    ^S - Slow down CW 2 WPM
    ^X - Switch headphones to Radio 1
    ^Y - Switch headphones to Radio 2
    ^Z - Switch headphones to Stereo

  These commands are executed at the time after the previous CW character
  has been sent and before the next one is sent.  You can put commands all
  by themselves in a CW message.  Probably some work to do with these
  functions being supported if in SSB mode.

- Added support for CWT and 7QP contests.  The CWT is still WIP as far
  as accurately counting multiliers goes.  7QP categories not correct
  for the Cabrillo log - but the log upload page fixes them.

0.51
- Fixed bug in Winkeyer start up code that caused K3NG Arduino
  code to fail to start.
- Updated files/mintsetup file that gives the commands needed for compiling on
  Linux Mint 20.2.

0.50
- Added check for Band and Mode out of range in multi info message
- Added checks for ncat, /bin/bash, and rigctld to halt program if
  they are requested but aren't installed in the path.
- Made winkeyer and yccc box cw word space 6 dits in agreement with
  TR DOS serial and parallel port keying.
- '^' character gives 4.5 dit space for TR DOS serial and parallel port keying.
  Made winkeyer '^' give same 4.5 dit space, YCCC box doesn't have 1/2 dit
  space, so '^' gives a 5 dit space.
- Fixed bug when empty bandmap
- Updated HID code and added delay for yccc box to remove race condition
  that sometimes caused a hang on startup
- Fixed bug where port is left off ncat
- Added NOSTDCFG command line parameter to not load STDCFG.DAT
- Rearranged source to compile on both Intel and Arm
- Added RADIO ONE CW REVERSE  = TRUE/FALSE
  and RADIO TWO CW REVERSE  = TRUE/FALSE
  to use cw reverse as default.
- Changed to RADIO ONE FREQUENCY POLL RATE and RADIO TWO FREQUENCY POLL RATE.

0.49
- Added "WRTC 2018" contest
- Deleted "WRTC 2002" contest
- Added UDP score reporting URL for WRTC2018
- Worked on improved Alt-D multiplier display.
- Fixed bug where CQ on radio 2 overwrote bandmap
- Fixed bug where only the first parallel port was found.
- When DVKRadio enabled, send stop dvk whenenver alt-r changes rig

0.48
- Online score reporting added. All options must be manually configured.

0.47
- Added latch mode for yccc so2r box.
- Added DVK radio commands to access rig's voice keyer as a DVK

0.46
- Changed postcab to write CABNAME.DAT to $HOME/.trlog if it isn't already
somewhere else that the program can find.

0.45
- Removed test for short names in TRMASTER.DTA
- Forced autospace off in YCCC box. Complain if you want this to be a
LOGCFG.DAT parameter.

0.44
- Fixed problem with DVK CONTROL KEY RECORD which continued to play F keys
rather than control keys.

0.43
- Added DVK CONTROL KEY RECORD as a LOGCFG.DAT command. Default is true.
Setting this to false makes the control keys act normally with a DVK
rather than triggering record on the corresponding not control key memories.
It can be set from the control-j menu.
- Fixed bug where, with the DVK/DVP, when a alt-d call is waiting, hitting the
space bar did not abort the cq in progress.

0.43
- Changed default LogFrequencyEnable to true for CQWW and Russian DX,
  so that exact frequencies (to 1KHz) will be logged by default as now
  required for competitive entries. For other contests the default
  remains false.
- Changed the rig control so that it will be easier to add new rigs
  and updates. This has been limited testing with Elecraft/Kenwood
  and Icom rigs.  FTDX5000 and FTDX3000 rigs have been added but not
  tested. There is also a new RIGCTLD rig which invokes the hamlib
  rigctld program. Hamlib needs to be installed if you want/need to use
  RIGCTLD. Otherwise, it is not needed. Support for the Tentec Orion,
  JST245 and some older Yaesu rigs (FT100, FT1000, etc.)  have not yet
  been updated to the new rig control. These will require rigctld and
  hamlib until their classes are written. (Or revert to an old version.)
  Various changes to get icom/kenwood/rigctld to work.

0.42
- Added support for using yccc so2r box pins 18:24 to control an external
dvk. To enable set:
dvk port = yccc
in LOGCFG.DAT. Pin 18 is DVK0, abort. Pins 19-24 or pulsed by DVK1-DVK6.
- Added source flag to compile for console only.

0.41
- Fixed bug where setting band map dupe display = false caused the
code to segmentation fault due to dereferenced bandmap nil pointers.

0.40
- Fixed missing chr(0) from end of url for country file CTY.DAT.
- Prepared for open source release under GPL. Added copyright notices
  and the license files.

0.39
- Reverted flashing fix of 0.37 until I study code more.
- Fixed bug where YCCC SO2R box switched the transmit rig back before
  the ptt tail time had expired when transmitting on the inactive rig.

0.38
- Made the child process that creates the shell in the control-b packet
  window a new session so its pseudo tty can be its controlling
  terminal. This turns on job control: control-c, control-z, etc.
  in the forked shell.
- Added arrow keys to the control-b packet window input, so they send the
  correct sequences to the shell to give a command history. Note that
  Tr has to emulate a terminal internally to make this work, so it
  only emulates the simplest glasstty. The history editing is rather
  minimal if you use the default emacs inputrc. (vi mode is somewhat more
  powerful.)

0.37
- Added a post option under utilities U then Y to download a new CTY.DAT
  file from http://www.country-files.com/cty/cty.dat which should make
  it a little easier to stay up to date. This uses libcurl which is a
  standard linux library.
- Fixed bug where the display flashed/flickered like mad when a rig was
  tuned to a duped band map entry. This bug was in the original DOS version.

0.36
- Included call to ask for low latency for USB serial ports. This may already
  be the driver default, but if not, it should make FTDI chips more responsive.
- Fixed bug where sound files were not being closed after playing.
- Made shifted alt keys the same as alt, etc. Caps lock can be used without
  causing the alt keys to stop working.
- With this version I have changed the compilation environment. Previous
  32 bit versions were compiled on a Slackware 13.37 machine, and the 64
  bit versions on a cinnamon Mint machine. For binary compatibility the
  code must be compiled using shared libraries at least as old as the
  oldest versions on a user's machine. Since both of these installations
  were getting out of date for actual operating system use, I have changed
  to compiling on chroot installations (and therefore with libraries)
  of Slackware 13.37 for both 32 and 64 bit versions. The compilation
  machine is running Slackware current. This automates the production
  of both versions from the git source archive, and should make it
  easier to make future releases. Please let me know if you find binary
  compatibility issues.

0.35
- Added Classic overlay to post.
- Added ptt when playing dvp files. Enable with ptt enable = true as in cw.

0.34
- Fixed bug I added to the linux version where radio interface stopped
  working at 0000Z.

0.33
- Fixed Cabrillo to renumber QSOs if frequency instead of numbers are included
  in the log.
- Fixed Adif Frequencies to be in MHz.
- Some initial modifications to be able to interface to fldigi for RTTY.
- Added Marconi Memorial Contest with 1 point for same country, 3 for same
  continent, 5 for different continent. This is also a choice in LOGCFG.DAT
  using QSO POINT METHOD = MMC.
- Allowed logging digital Qs without having an rtty port hooked up.
- Increased MaxCallBlocks, MaxBigCallBlocks.

0.32
- Ported post Cabrillo routines from 6.96. This gives Cabrillo 3.0 header,
  and reports frequencies to 1 KHz if log frequencye enable is set to true.
- Ported post utility routines from 6.96. This gives a simple adif file,
  among other additions.
- Added frequencies and header to adif output.
- Installed new signal handlers so trlog will try to write a core file when
  an illegal instruction, floating point exception, or segmentation fault
  occurs. Typically, you need to set ulimit -c unlimited in order to produce
  a core file.
- Added a manual section to trloglinux.pdf, describing how to generate
  a core file when the program crashes, and what I need to find the problem
  that generated it.
- Added a table of contents to trloglinux.pdf.

0.31
- Added XE as domestic multiplier in ARRL10
- N6TR sent me source for version 6.96 -- ported his fix for CQ160 to properly
  log the zone
- Fixed post to produce Cabrillo file for CQ160 with zone
- Updated the documentation with suggestions from K5TR with a less
  caveman method of adding users to groups.

0.30
- Fixed bug where Winkeyer sidetone pin changes were not sent to
  the Winkeyer.
- Fixed bug where race condition in YCCC box caused some dropped CW
  characters when interrupting a CQ message on one radio to send
  an alt-d space bar to work a station on the second radio.

0.29
- Multiple changes so that all the pascal routines can be compiled in objfpc
  mode. Note this changes some of the binary representations, so old
  binary files like restart.bin etc. cannot be used. If problems are
  found please revert to an older version and report bugs.
- Rewrote code so that loop variables are no longer modified within loops
- Changed Borland pascal comments where one right brace closed multiple
  left braces to comments where every left brace has a matching right brace.
- Fixed dead code where word variables were tested for impossible negative
  values.
- Removed unused variables.
- Removed assigned but never used variables.
- Sped up multi network and packet. The original DOS code had delays to keep
  from overrunning the one byte hardware buffers of serial ports at 4800 baud.
  Since the linux kernel has 1K buffers, and network buffers are even larger,
  these delays were removed. Reads/writes to the multi network and packet
  now work with multiple bytes per simulated DOS interrupt.

0.28
- Fixed bug where ptt would not release in yccc box.

0.27
- Fixed setting the keyer weight. This fixes a bug in setting keyer weight
  introduced in the first winkeyer version when the different keyers
  were separated.
- Made PTT PADDLE HOLD COUNT work with the YCCC SO2R box keyer.

0.26
- Fixed YCCC SO2R box keyer weight being reported incorrectly in
  control-j menu.
- Fixed YCCC SO2R box PTT turn on time setting.
- Set YCCC SO2R box PTT turn off time to 15ms

0.25
- Fixed YCCC SO2R box keyer defaults not being set from LOGCFG.DAT
- Removed USE BIOS KEY CALLS configuration parameter since direct reading
  of BIOS memory wouldn't work on a real operating system anyway.
- Fixed bug in original 6.76 code where packet spots were given the wrong
  frequency.
- Fixed bug in original 6.76 code where the check for stable rig frequency
  was calculated incorrectly.
- Fixed bug in original 6.76 code where FT847 and FT817 frequencies were
  not updated correctly.

0.24
- Fixed writing SO2R box commands to LOGCFG.DAT from control-j menu.

0.23
- Added native support for the YCCC SO2R box <http://k1xm.org/SO2R/index.html>.
  No additional programs needed, just make sure you are set up with
  permission to use the YCCC SO2R usb device, plug in the usb cable,
  set YCCC SO2R BOX ENABLE = true in LOGCFG.DAT and it should just work,
  at least at a basic level. TR sends CW, switches the rigs, puts band
  data on the SO2R box DB25 connector, has new message commands to switch
  receive between hearing both main receivers in stereo, or either rig
  (main and sub receiver if so equipped) in both ears, and blends audio.
- Added documentation for how to use the YCCC SO2R box in trloglinux.pdf
- Control-P menu now displays control characters in messages.
- Fixed footswitch bug

0.22
- Fixed bug in Winkeyer code which reported cw not being sent when a message
  was staged, but not yet started. This kept CW messages on the inactive radio
  from being sent.
- Made shifted keys work for message programming.

0.21
- Added new line so initial set up of field day is formatted better
- Fixed some shift and control key combinations to ignore caps lock
  and num lock.
- Fixed bug in 64 bit parallel port record size so that parallel port
  access on 64 bit systems works.
- Fixed bug in active/inactive radio selection introduced with Winkeyer
  code.

0.20
- Added right-control carriage return (left-control carriage return worked
  before) logging without sending CW to be compatible with DOS TR.
- Fixed bug where the DOS lowercase function in assembly language had
  been commented out. Contests which used grid squares need this.

0.19
- Fixed post not reading restart file if log is LOG.DAT
- Fixed swappaddles and ptt for Winkeyer.

0.18
- Improved X11 handling of some special keys to minimize polling. This makes
  running trlog over a network remotely work much better, and CW sending with
  serial/parallel ports is less affected by cpu activity.
- Added AltShift option to Shift Key Enable. This changes the tuning and
  RIT keys from Shift left or Shift right to Alt-Shift left and Alt-Shift
  right. Both shifts together (without Alt) clears RIT. The previous true
  and false options work as before, with default true as before. The
  question mark and other shifted characters work normally with
  Shift Key Enable = AltShift.

0.17
- Changed the signal sent from trlog to the packet shell process when trlog
  shuts down from SIGKILL to SIGHUP. SIGHUP causes telnet to quit, while
  SIGKILL left zombie telnet sessions which would keep new instances of trlog
  waiting for resources to become available until the zombie telnet sessions
  were killed.

0.16
- Fixed bug added with Winkeyer support where parallel paddle port
  configuration had to be before keyer output port in LOGCFG.DAT or the paddle
  port was ignored.
- First pass at making this properly multiuser. Writing CABNAME.DAT and
  ADDRESS.DAT or TRMASTER.DTA will store result in $HOME/.trlog instead
  of main trlog directory. If correct a normal user will not need write
  permission for the trlog executable's directory.

0.15
- Added a test for utf-8 locales. The degree symbol is hex 0xb0 in iso8859
  locales, and hex 0xc2 0xb0 in utf-8 locales. It should now print correctly
  on all systems.

0.14
- Added a test so that /dev/port, which is erroneously reported by
  ieee1284_find_ports as a parallel port on systems with no parallel ports,
  is not displayed.

0.13
- Attempt to fix serial port issues on some systems.

0.12
- Fixed the command line option ports so "trlog ports" should now report
  something sensible. As far as I can tell linux does not have a library
  routine to detect serial ports. trlog therefore searches the /sys pseudo
  file system (i.e. the /sys/class/tty directory) for ports with attached
  drivers.
- Added serial, parallel, winkeyer and packet prompting to set up a new
  LOGCFG.DAT. The program attempts to detect the serial and parallel ports
  connected to the computer using the same method as the ports command line
  option.
- Updated doc/trloglinux.pdf and files/Xresources to describe how to use
  nicer xterm fonts.
- Changed the degree symbol to be decimal 176 as shown in "man iso_8859-15".

0.11
- Slightly different, possibly better, method of initializing Winkeyer

0.10
- This version has major changes to the cw keyer parts of the code. Tree's
  code for keying the serial and parallel ports has been encapsulated in
  a new keyer class to allow adding other keying options easily. This means
  that if you are using serial or parallel port keying, this version could
  break things that worked before. If you find a show stopper in the keyer,
  please report the bug and revert to using version 0.09.
- Support for K1EL's Winkeyer has been added. Please see the trloglinux.pdf
  file for more information.
- Support for Ultimatic mode has been added.

0.09
- Fixed bug which scribbles outside the box when displaying the log with
  Control-L when a Control-L in the log is encountered.

0.08
- Fixed bug added by changes to packet in 0.07 that sometimes dropped
  the first character of a spot.
- Commented lines that prevented K3 DVK commands from working.

0.07
- Fixed bug in radio 2 control communication
- Fixed uninitialized variable that made sunrise/sunset times wrong on 64 bit
  versions.
- Fixed bug where a long packet string would shut down packet on the local
  machine -- packet through the multi network would still sort of work.
- Added shell device for packet
- Added ncat device for multi net

0.06
- Fixed problem with packet etc., from printing control-g instead of beeping.
- Allow autocq on phone with function key radio commands.

0.05
- Fixed problem in two radio alt-d port.

0.04
- Added 4 Ontario sections to SS simulator
- Added support for normal pseudottys. Use any name whose first 3 characters
  are pty or PTY for the serial device. Trlog will open a master pseudotty
  and write the slave device in the file given by the name you used.

0.03
- Changed Cabrillo output in post to have lines ending in carriage return /
  line feed.  At least some log checking codes running under DOS/Windows
  do not accept the unix/Mac line feed only end of line character. Thanks
  to Tim, K9TM for the heads up.
- Fixed null pointer references giving segmentation faults when adding to
  the end of the visible dupe sheet.

0.02:
- Unoptimized the xterm ANSI move cursor commands. My xterm did not always
  work with the optimized sequences, which caused occasional glitches.
  Using the unoptimized command makes the display more robust.  I haven't
  notice any speed difference.
- Added shift key detection under Xwindows so shift key tuning, shift
  key RIT, and ctrl-shift keying work.
- Added paddle input on serial ports. This violates the RS-232 standard
  which defines the two logic levels as positive and negative voltages,
  while the paddle will only key a positive voltage to ground. But,
  according to the ARRL handbook, none of the serial port chips used
  actually require a negative voltage on their inputs to get the correct
  logic level.  Therefore, I have set up the clear to send (CTS) input as
  the left paddle (normally dot) input, and data set ready (DSR) input as
  the right paddle (normally dash) input. You need to pull these inputs
  positive through resistors.  I pull them up to +12 volts through 10K ohm
  resistors (the RS-232 standard requires anything between 3 and 25 volts),
  and the paddle keys those inputs to ground. On a DB9 connector they are
  pins 6 (DSR) and 8 (CTS). Ground is pin 5.
- Fixed bug where exact calls in CTY.DAT with / did not match.
- Changed default to UTC, independent of your system clock.  The hour
  offset should now never need to be used if your system clock is correct,
  but I didn't remove it. I also added code so the time set functions
  work internally to trlog. Originally these set the DOS system time. Now
  it just changes an internal offset. If you exit TR, this will not be
  saved. I believe the only reason to change the internal time would be to
  type in hand-written logs after a contest. Otherwise, you should simply
  set your system time correctly.
- Fixed several bugs related to auto character count cw.

0.01:
- Initial release based on DOS TR 6.76
