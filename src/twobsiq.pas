TODO LIST

 - "ActiveBand" cursor on the band totals display is not right.

 - Anyway to quickly turn on monitor tone for manual sending?  either automagic or manual

 - When starting AutoStartSend when the other radio is sending CW - the indicator is
   yellow until the exchange starts.  This isn't a big deal and perhaps more trouble
   than it is worth to fix it.

 - In Classic mode - pressing F1 in S&P with a call in the call window does
   indeed put you in the exchange window with the initial exchange, except
   it is at the start of the window where the InitialExchangeCursorPos = AtEnd

 - RepeatSearchAndPounceExchange not used in 2BSIQ yet.  Will always use the non
   repeat one.

  - Intiial exchange has a space?

  - Show country and beam headings? (Fixed?)

  - AltK is not well behaved.

  - If in SSB - remove AutoStartSend arrows

  - Need to use new TQ command for dualing CQs on SSB

  - In Classic mode - start of CW of dualing CQs sounds funny.

  - Serial number needs better way to start off if recording freqs

NOTES FROM SSCW:

    > character in CW messages clears RIT on wrong radio

    As I got more contacts, the QSO before message was chopped some

    Also, with more QSOs, saw a flash of yellow before CQ EXCHANGE

    Improve indication of dualing CQ status

    I think Alt-Enter should log a QSO even if it was a dupe - not
    sure if that is always true in S&P

    Would be nice to get capital letters when editing log.  Same for
    Memory program (like shift keys for characters).

NOTES FROM ARRL DX CW

  - I keep calling dupes in S&P mode - need better warnings.
  - Dualing CQs not working?
  - Not getting SCP calls from log?

  - Improve sending RTTY message from keyboard

CHANGE LOG - this is really mostly 2BSIQ - see TR.PAS for everything else

18-Jan-2023
  - Started adding support for some network stuff in 2BSIQ.

03-Nov-2023

  - Not really a change - but played around with the footswitch and quickly
    came to the realization that since we only have one footswitch - it breaks
    the two keyboard philosophy and trying to figure out which radio should
    respond to the footswitch is just too weird.  So - best to not use it at
    all - except for passing PTT to the active radio when in NORMAL.

07-Aug-2023

  - Played around with the variable SearchAndPounceExchangeSent some to make
    sure it got set and unset at the right times.  I had a few times during the
    NAQP where I was surprised that an exchange didn't get sent when logging a
    QSO.

05-Aug-2023

  - Initial exchange was broken if you had overwrite enabled.  Fixed this bug.

13-Jun-2023
  - Attempted to clean up the mult display on bandmap entries for WPX.

03-Jun-2023
  - Made station info for complete callsign come up after auto start send is done.
  - Allowed country check of two letter callsigns.

02-Jun-2023
  - Fixed QSO_UDP record where last call popped off editable log window was being sent.

21-Mar-2023

  - Fixed case of QSONumberByBand.

19-Mar-2023

  - Fixed backspace getting overwritten by BandMapBlinkingCall (similar to fix in
    classic UI).

09-Mar-2023

   - If in the middle of a QSO and you are editing the CallWindow and hit
     RETURN when the Exchange window doesn't have a valid exchange in it,
     the cursor will now jump to the Exchange window (this matches the
     behavior in classic mode).

   - Made INITIAL EXCHANGE OVERWRITE work in TBSIQ.

24-Feb-2023

   - Removed AltD feature.

   - If you are messing around with a callsign in the call window with AutoStartSend enabled,
     you could get the AutoStartSend to trigger if you came at the AutoStartSendCharacterCount
     by deleting a character.  This is no longer possible.  There has always been a mechanism
     to rearm the auto start send if you go down to two letters and then enter more stuff.

23-Feb-2023

   - AUTO PARTIAL CALL FETCH implemented.  Takes three letters and turns it into a full call if
     there is only one SCP call shown (when coming back to a call and pressing ENTER).

   - Fixed bug where SCP stops processing additional callsign input after auto start send.
   - Fixed bug where entering JA1/ started auto start send.
   - Fixed bug where expanding a callsign from the middle will trigger auto start send.
   - Fixed bug where pressing ESCAPE after auto start send jumps you into sending the exchange.

19-Feb-2023

   - Made sending @ in a function key message update CallsignICameBackTo

06-Feb-2023

   - Hopefully enabled escape key to get out of Alt-D mode.

   - Hopefully fixed bug where the wrong radio was being indcated some of the
     time with the UDP messages - thus making Qsorder save the wrong channel
     some of the time.

   - Fixed the visible dupesheet being pretty brain dead.  Now works good for
     the sprint hopefully.  It basically uses the same criteria as the band map
     to switching bands.

04-Feb-2023

  - Some minor fixes with the AutoStartSend feature.  First off - if it is
    enabled in classic mode - typing 2BSIQ will not start a transmission so
    you can enter 2BSIQ without having to turn AutoStartSend off.  A minor
    bug where you had to press the Alt-Dash key twice occasionally has been
    fixed - and also the AutoStartSend state (which is called
    AutoStartSendEnable in the local variable for the QSOMachine instance) is
    copied from the Classic global variable - so both QSOMachines should come
    up in the same Classic state.

02-Feb-2023

  - If callsing CQ on one radio and wanting to send F1 in S&P mode - CW will be
    stopped on the CQing radio.

19-Jan-2023
  - Supported updating the bandmap output.

14-Jan-2023
  - Added support for N4OGW bandmap commands and VFO support.

07-Jan-2023
  - Cleaned up some stuff with RTTY.  Trying to make it as consistent to
    CW and Classic as much as possible.  Note that you do not use CQ EXCHANGE
    and must program EX Function Key memories F1 and F2.  MY CALL is not
    automatically used when you call someone in S&P

25-Dec-2022

  - Added the Control-Q CW character to get the frequency from the other
    radio.  This is the identical function as added to the classic mode
    but the implementation is totally unique to TBSIQ.  It will also
    generate a note to the log file indicating who was asked to go where.

  - Cleaned up retry message from SO2R mini so pieces of it don't get left
    over and displayed forever just after the Score total window.

23-Dec-2022

  - Added AUTO QSY REQUEST ENABLE parameter (control-J) which is intended to
    automatically ask someone who is a multiplier to QSY to the other band
    when 2BSIQing.  It is intended that it only do this when the other band
    has some minimum number of QSOs (so you aren't doing this for easy
    multipliers) and when for sure you are actively calling CQ on the
    other frequency.

    This is still in the idea phase.  I need to make some kind of mechanism
    that keeps tracks of the CQ activtiy of each radio.  Then I need a
    function that looks at that data to decide if I am active on an
    established frequency before asking someone to QSY to that frequency.

    But maybe before doing that - I should make sure I have a manual way of
    doing it using CW messsage character for the frequency of the other radio.
    I think I remember implementing that sometime ago?  It appears note - so
    let's add that first (for both calssic and 2BSIQ).

28-Nov-2022
  - Realized that these removal of PttUnforce was kind of a bad idea as
    the SO2R mini should keep PTT asserted if it has characters in the
    buffer when seeing this command.  This is resulting in the brief
    letup of PTT with the CW messages after a callsign is sent and before
    the CQ exchange shows up after we have enough QSOs.

    So - the SO2R mini firmware needed to be changed so it emulates how
    things worked before - and the PTTUnassert commands put back into
    the high level program (both classic and 2BSIQ).  Also, we need
    to force PTT on while sending a callsign in CQ mode so that the
    gap until we sent the CQ EXCHANGE is covered.

    Finally, since we are updating the SO2R mini firmware, we are going
    to fix the ^ character being a command prefix - and make it work
    as a half space like it is supposed to.

    Along with that will be checking the SO2R mini version now and giving
    a warning message if it isn't up to date.

    The new SO2R Mini firmare version is TRCW4 V4.

    The new SO2R Mini command prefix is now semi-colon.

26-Nov-2022

  - In effort to make PTT work again in classic mode while sending CW,
    I restored the old SendCrypticCW procedure in logsubs1.pas.  It had
    been moved to logedit.pas in an attempt to let the TBSIQ stuff
    leverage it - but that didn't work out.  Turns out that I needed
    to delete a ClearPttForceOn command at the end of SendCrypticCWString
    in LOGSUBS1.PAS.

  - Insert status now comes up the same as what you had in classic UI.

15-Nov-2022

  - Removed Deleted Call message.

  - Improved operation with dualing CQs on SSB.  A message in progress will
    be stopped once a key is entered on the opposite radio in response to
    a CQ.  This is different from CW where the CQ will finish out before
    the call is answered.

14-Nov-2022

  - Fixed nasty bandmap issue where calls were bleeding over to the wrong
    radio.  This turned out to be a case of assuming that the "real" active
    window was already setup if the radio specific active window seemed to
    be correct.  There might be other places lurking where you need to put
    a SetTBSIQWindow (TBSIQ_ActiveWindow) command to make sure the correct
    window is up.  This normally happens when a key is pressed - but if
    something automatic like switching between band map focus without a
    keystroke, then you might be in the wrong place.

09-Nov-2022

  - Fixed bug where PTT was being deasserted before completing the character
    being sent by the Arduino when the operator is pressing ESCAPE. This was
    fixed by removing the PTT unassert command in LOGCW in the FlushBuffer
    prodcedure.

05-Nov-2022

  - Fixed UserInfo not coming up with CQ QSOs

04-Nov-2022

  - Fixed S&P indicator if enabled.

  - Made sure remaining mults get updated when logging a QSO.

  - Put editable log back up when sending CQ exchange (clearing out the partial
    call window).

03-Nov-2022

  - Fixed ^ character in Arduino (see main program notes)

  - Moved User Info Window above the INSERT window so it no longer gets
    overwritten by the Auto Start Send indicator.  Note that it appears
    you need to put the TRMASTER.BIN file in the working directory for
    the contest.

  - In S&P - made AltZ (used to go from CallWindow to ExchangeWindow and
    get initial exchange) show station info.

30-Oct-2022

  - Found case where I had some letters in the call window and could not
    clear them even though the call window string was empty.  Added a
    ClrScr.  This happened when I was doing something with the bandmap
    or a dupe check on the other radio.

28-Oct-2022

  - Attempted to fix occasional wrong use of 59/599 based upon mode.

27-Oct-2022

  - Added Alt-D command which will send input to the call window of the other radio
    and then do a dupecheck when hitting RETURN.

  - Eliminated packet messages from showing up using QuickDisplay

26-Oct-2022

 - Added check for packet spots.

 - Added support for Control-B to access packet window.

 - Added new command - PACKET AUTO SPOT (jctrl) which when true will automatically
   send spots to packet when doing a dupe check in SearchAndPounce

25-Oct-2022

 - If there is no SearchAndPouncePhoneExchange, then the program will try to use
   the Exchange SSB Memory F2 when pressing F2.  If you want the S&P exchange sent
   automatically when you press ENTER to log a QSO - use S&P SSB EXCHANGE.

 - Added display of countryID, sunrise/sunset times and beam heading.
 - Added AltH function (Help Menu)
 - Added AltG function (swap mult display)

 - Made it so blank SSB messages do not trigger the ariticial TX timer.

 - Added new call window command UPDATEQSONR.  This will burn the current QSO number
   and get a new one.  This is intended to be used when the QSO number is old and
   you would rather send a more current number (instead of #2 on Sunday morning of
   the SS).

24-Oct-2022

  - I added a way for the QSO number to be stolen from the other radio if it hasn't
    been used.  This only works if the QSO number is greater than the one you just
    gave out - and no keys have been typed in the other radio's window.

  - Fixed obscure bug where the routine to clear the CW messages was never coming
    back true indicating that a message was deleted.  This caused a small issue where
    hitting ESCAPE would both stop the CW message and also do the next thing the escape
    key would have done with a 2nd press.  Typically that meant clearing whatever was
    in the active window.

  - Fixed bug introduced by adding station information after logging a QSO having the
    data come out in the call window of the 2nd radio.

  - Shortened message about sending S&PExchange message if there is one - so that it
    fits into the window.

  - Show station updated station information after logging a QSO.

  - Remove WPM display if on SSB.

  - Improved listening time display with auto-CQ.

  - Think I got the band map blinking call stuff going into the call window
    working well.

  - First escape will clear call window - second one will clear possible call diplay.
    the possible call display also disappears when a QSO is made.

  - Made editable log appear after initialization of keyboards.  Before, you had to make
    a QSO first.

23-Oct-2022

  - AutoCQ supported.  Works basically the same as classic - exccept the default
    listen time is four seconds.  You can adjust it during listening time in
    half second increments using PageUp/Dn.  PageUp/Dn during transmit will
    change the CW speed.

  - Added a time window where function key memories are blocked out for about 200
    ms after pressing one.  Eliminates double messages on SSB.

  - Moved the "is a dupe" message up in S&P so the call gets shown.  Changed
    colors for it.  Made message go away after 3 seconds.  Made editable log
    come up right away.  Made it impossible for that dupe call to get back in
    the call window for 3 seconds.

  - MAde it harder to spot garbage - like something that does not look like a
    call or a double callsign



22-Oct-2022

 - In S&P - made new band map entry when calling station.

18-Oct-2022

 - More work with band map and radio on the move to make things as identical to
   the classic mode as possible.  It appears to be working as intended.

 - One of the two new kittens has discovered the radio room - so we might have some
   new "features" added by paw prints on the keyboard.

17-Oct-2022

  - Much work done improving band map operation.  It seems to basically work but
    might hae some rough edges.

  - Made S&P Exchange window conform to established colors (green).

  - Made state of CQSending73Message last until message complete on both
    SSB and RTTY.  This helps keep the display of the message up for awhile.

  - Made DualingCQs work on RTTY.

  - Changed the scope of disabling keys from initiating action whlie the other
    radio is transmitting.  This was done because I didn't have an effective
    lockout for the QSL message.  Basically - anything that could possibly start
    a transmission (when both rigs are not on CW) will be defeated until the
    transmission is complete.  You can add characters to the window you are
    in and perform operations like AltE - but some things like hitting TAB
    to enter Search And Pounce mode are also disabled.  Just to be clear, keys
    are disabled - not buffered.  You will have to hit the key again after
    the transmission is complete.

  - Kept Alt-E from messing up the call window for radio two.  It was trying to
    display the INSERT mode status.  Note that Alt-E never allows INSERT status
    anyway.

  - RETURN in S&P mode if the station already called was not sending the S&P
    exchange (at least on RTTY - but maybe SSB).  This is now fixed.

  - Changed minimum time for the RED TX indicator for SSB and RTTY to 3 seconds
    instead of two.  I was occasionally seeing it drop out before the rig status
    updated to TX.

16-Oct-2022

  - Cleaned up digital use of exchange function keys.  See notes in main program.
  - Some work keeping "CW" messages up on RTTY and Phone

15-Oct-2022

  - Added support for RTTY (with K3/K4).  Did play a little bit with Phone stuff
    too - trying to improve lockouts.

10-Oct-2022

  - Added explicit "listen to other rig" when calling dualing CQ.

9-Oct-2022

 - Improved Dualing CQs to work on SSB.  Again, it does not automatically
   send a blind CQ or pick up again after a QSO is logged like it does in classic
   mode.  You have to manually restart it with the Control-Dash key on either
   keyboard.  The first CQ will be sent on the radio/keyboard the control-dash
   is pressed on.

 - The faster poll rate didn't seem to really be working - and the response
   seemed okay without it - so I removed it.

8-Oct-2022

 - Added immediate flag for transmit status on SSB.

- Put K3/K4 radio into faster poll rate for TX status when looking for the
   end of a transmission.

- Got DualingCQs kind of working on CW - aborted by any keystroke.  Use
  Control-Dash to start or restart it.

5-Oct-2022

 - Rate windows moved to just above the QSONeeds window.

 - New QSO number methodology.  Next QSO number comes from looking at the log
   files.  Also implemented consistently with classic mode.

2-Oct-2022

 - Change how the TX ID and TX Color and Insert get displayed - I remember what
   was last displayed and if someone is asking to display the same thing, I do
   not do anything.  This eliminated some scenarios where rapid flashing would
   occur.

- Momentarily removed the lockout from the transmitter being busy.

30-Sep-2022

 - Fixed cursor being in wrong place after initializing the second radio.

29-Sep-2022

 - Enabled frequency input in call window for VFO A
 - Fixed control/shift function key memories not working.
 - Added support for F13, F14 and F15 on an apple keyboard > Control-F3, F4 and F5.

28-Sep-2022

 - Found a case where AutoStartSend didn't want to work.  Changed ActiveMode to Mode
   as a qualifier and that seemed to fix it.

 - Improved how the Alt-P memories are shown with regard to mode.

27-Sep-2022

 - Fixed CW messages getting sent when not in CW mode

 - Support for QSO number on SSB.  You need to put # in the apporpirate memory.
   Note that if you put the # in the S&P SSB EXCHANGE message - you have to
   press F2 for that message to be "executed" and thus generate a QSO Number.

9-Sep-2022

 - Made ControlEnter work for moving forward in a QSO without sending CW.

8-Sep-2022

 - ShowStationInfo mostly working.  QSO and Mult status uses classic windows
 - Added vertical line between the two QSO machines.
 - TotalScore now getting updated after each QSO.

7-Sep-2022

 - Added Alt-U command

 - PossibleCall window getting removed after logging QSO - or enough ESCAPE
   presses.

4-Sep-2022

 - Possible Calls added.  Moved the CW message display up to make room.
 - Noticed rig two windows were starting at column 40, not 41.
 - Made two keyboards with same mfg id work.  Can also use laptop keyboard.
 - Insert mode display added
 - Eliminated *** debug message when unknown key pressed

3-Sep-2022

  - Implmeneted SPRINT QSY RULE
  - Tried again to fix the AutoStartSend being brain dead occasionally.  Need to test in CWT.
  - Much improvement with BandMap
  - Added support for \ key send QuickQSLMessage1.  Currently hardwired.
  - Fixed speed changes during CW message aborting message.

  - Made hitting F1 or RETURN when calling a station in S&P put you in the
    exchange window with the initial exchange if the call appears valid.
    Note that the cursor is always at the end - irregardless of the setting
    for initial exchange cursor pos.

2-Sep-2022

 - Fixed S/N not going past 1 in S&P.
 - Fixed AltZ operation so the exchange window always comes up and is correct
 - Made # with no callwindow and no exchange window contents in 2BSIQ send previous QSO #

 - Did a little code cleanup in LogWind in the UpdateTimeAndRate displays with the
   radio display code.

 - Fixed ESCAPE key with blank exchange window in S&P not resetting the flag indicating
   that the callsign has been sent.  Note that in normal mode - if you press ESCAPE with
   and empty exchange window - the call window clears too.  In 2BSIQ - you first end up
   going to the call window - and then clearing it with a second escape.  Not sure this
   inconsistency is a problem.

**** 0.54 release

1-Sep-2022

 - Attempted to make active radio go to the one you just hit a function key for.

 - Made SRS command go to the radio tied to the instance it was initiated from

 - Added CWO contest and added CWT and CWO to the log prompt menu.

 - Changed format of the SERIALNUMBER.TXT file to have the prefix QNR: for lines
   created when reserving a QSO number.  I updated the format shown under 31-Aug.

 - Added QLQ: entry to SERIALNUMBER.TXT to show the contents of the call window
   when the QSO is actually logged.

   QLQ: 14 2022-09-01 21:55:03 K7BH

 - Made the QSO number sent get logged.

 - Fixed bug where exchanges were being put in the CW buffer as urgent priority and
   could come out before the callsign was sent in some cases.

31-Aug-2022

  - Came up with my prototype for doing QSO Numbers.  The key to this is a text file
    called SERIALNUMBER.TXT.  If there is no file, then the first QSO number that will
    be sent will be #1.  Whenever a new QSO number is sent - it is assigned to that
    QSO that is progress.  For each - and entry into the SERIALNUMBER.TXT file will be
    made that looks like this (updated with 1-Sep changes):

    QNR: 1 2022-08-31 21:23:50 K3LR 7027940 40 CW

    If a QSO ends up not getting logged - the entry stays in this file and the next
    QSO number will be fetched when needed.

    This file will be looked at when the program starts up to determine what the next
    QSO number should be.  It will be one plus that last number in the file.

    Using the # in the exchange memories during the QSO before it is logged will repeat
    the same number that was originally sent.

  - Fixed flashing cursor between call windows when both rigs sending 73 message.

  - I believe I have made SSB work with function keys with 2BSIQ.

24-Aug-2022

  - Added dupe checking for both CQ and S&P modes (if enabled).

  - Bandmaps is stort of starting to work - but not sure it is 100 percent yet.

  - Fixed CWT multiplier calculation.

  - Occasionally, Autostart send is brain dead if very busy on other radio.
  - Need to setup @ + CQExchange on F3

23-Aug-2022

  - Search And Pounce implemented.  Probably lots of missing details, but you
    can actually work guys with it.  Probably not working on SSB yet.

  - One new feature with S&P.  If you have an empty call window - press F1 to
    send your callsign and then enter a call - and then hit RETURN (nothing yet
    entered into the exchange window) - the initial exchange will get filled
    in the exchange window - and if there is enough info there to log the QSO,
    it will be logged instantly.

  - Allowed SPACE BAR with nothing in call window to jump into S&P and send
    my call.

  - Added support for commands in function key and QSO messages.  A few were
    deleted that make no sense in the context of 2BSIQ.  Also, LogLastCall
    turned out to be difficult to implement without major surgery of the
    existing code - so it was deleted.

19-Aug-2022

  - In order to guarantee we don't get a message interjected from
    the other radio while finishing off an auto start send - I have
    disabled the keyboard during the brief time auto start send has
    started sending CW - until the call is terminated.

  - AltP now works in 2BSIQ.

  - Added new LOGCFG command - 2BSIQ HEADPHONE SWITCHING ENABLE (TRUE or FALSE).
    This is also in the ControlJ menu.  If FALSE, no headphone switching
    is done with 2BSIQ.  Gets rid of annoying relay clicks if you are
    not using it.

  - Made SO2R MICROPHONE RELAY ENABLE work with SO2R mini.

  - Changed how the colored displays work for the transmit message status.
    The information flows from the message cue now instead of being set
    by the state machine.

  - Changed how CQ messages are processed so that there is no longer a
    window where you can press a key on the other radio and interject a
    message between the callsign and CQ exchange.

  - Did a bunch of work with the CW message cue - getting priorities to
    work - although they really aren't doing anything for me at this point,
    so you should not see any impact.


18-Aug-2022

  - Good enough support for : in CW message (expected to be in F10)

  - Copied SCP code from LOGEDIT.PAS into TBSIQ_SUBS and cleaned up the
    routine to use TBSIQ keystrokes.  Not sure this resulted in any change
    to how it appears to work.

17-Aug-2022

  - Fixed a bug that was causing hangs when employing auto start send.  I
    was getting stuck in the CWFinished loop because I kept setting the Index
    (temporary pointer) to the start of the cue.

  - Made F1 and F2 work when exchange window up.

  - Fixed intiial exchanges when working a station previously logged.

  - Fixed bug of empty function key exchanges sending garbage.

16-Aug-2022

  - Implemented AltZ to recompute initial exchange based upon call window.
    This perhaps works a little different from AltZ in the main program
    as you can use it in any QSOState.  If the exchange window is not up,
    it will put it up for you but not change the QSO state.  It will only
    put up an intiial exchange if there is one for the callsign - otherwise,
    it will leave the Exchange Window alone.  Not sure if this is the best
    way - but give it a try.

  - Fixed a few places ClearKeyCache needed to be set - like when exiting
    the ControlJ menu.  This flag will gobble up any characters
    that are processed by the "normal" keyboard interface (which bypasses
    totally the two keyboard process).

  - Verified that CallsignUpdateEnable works - and made the exchange window
    wider so there was room for doing that.

  - Cleaned up display (Call and Exchange Windows) while QSL Message being
    sent instead of waiting for it to end.

  - Supporting a reduced set of cryptic CW characters.  # is currently a
    concept not implemented yet.  Have _ (leading space), @ (call window
    string with no fancy stuff), : (send keyboard input which kind of works
    but messes up the display - so needs work), \ (send MyCall), | (send
    RX data name), LeftCurlyBracket (send RX data callsign) and > (clear RIT).
    These are used in any of the function key memories or things like CQ
    EXCHANGE and QSL MESSAGE.

  - Fixed bug that would stop CW from being sent if the CW speed was changed
    on the other radio.

15-Aug-2022

  - Made PageUp/PageDn work to change CW speeds in real time
  - Made TX indicator stay when changing code speed
  - Enabled numeric keypad PageUp/Dn keys to control CW speed
  - Started implemention of SearchAndPounce Mode - not completed yet.

14-Aug-2022 (or before)

  - Added TX to the CW Speed display to show which rig has the TX focus if you
    start sending by hand.  You can change it to the other rig with AltR (on
    either keyboard).
